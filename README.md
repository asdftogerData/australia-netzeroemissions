## Historical emissions

### Sectoral emissions explainer

Electricity, stationary energy, transport, and fugitive emissions are a subset of energy emissions. 

#### Stationary energy excluding electricity
Emissions from direct combustion of fuels, predominantly from the manufacturing, mining, residential and commercial sectors.

#### Transport 
Emissions from the direct combustion of fuels in transportation by road, rail, domestic aviation and domestic shipping. The main fuels used for transport are automotive gasoline
(petrol), diesel oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and aviation turbine fuel.

#### Fugitive emissions 
Emissions that occur during the production, processing, transport, storage, transmission and
distribution of fossil fuels.

#### Industrial processes and product use
Emissions that occur as the result of by-products of materials and reactions used in production processes. This sector includes emissions from processes used to produce chemical, metal, and mineral products. It also includes emissions from the consumption of synthetic gases.

#### Agriculture
Emissions including methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions are estimated for enteric fermentation and manure management in livestock. They are also estimated for rice cultivation, agricultural soils and field burning of agricultural residues. Carbon dioxide emissions are reported from the application of urea and lime.

#### Waste
Emissions from landfills, wastewater treatment, waste incineration and the biological treatment of solid waste. Emissions largely consist of methane, which is generated when organic matter decays under anaerobic conditions.

#### LULUCF
Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), referred to as carryover credits/Kyoto credit, is omitted from this modelling as it widely condemned as an accounting trick rather than actual sectoral emissions.


## Carbon budgets
The 1.5C and 2C global carbon budget numbers. A country's "fair share" of the global carbon budget is ultimately a political question, be it the 5 crtieria outlined in IPCC report, world population %, etc..


If we use world population %, 0.33, Australia has exceeded its fair share of the 1.5C and 2C global carbon budget.
If we use the CCA fair share, 0.97, Australia

The Australian Academy of Sciences thinks that limiting warming to below 1.5C is impossible, see <https://www.science.org.au/supporting-science/science-policy-and-analysis/reports-and-publications/risks-australia-three-degrees-c-warmer-world>.

What would decarbonising sectors look like?
